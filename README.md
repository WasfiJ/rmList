# rmList for Windows
Multithreaded delete of a list of files.

Do you have a million files to delete in hurry ?

Use: rmList input_file

Could not find this anywhere. I share in the hope this can help you.

Takes a list of file paths and deletes using multiple threads (UTF-8 input).

Adjust thMax to your wishes.

Planned features (if requested) :
- Choose number of threads automatically
- Delete folders that become empty after deleting files in input file
- Detailed reporting
- Delete non-empty folders
- Try to unlock files/folders to force deletion (dangerous)

Please report any issues/requests to wj.osprojects@gmail.com

Wasfi.
